          <h2>Decoding Nature, the base course of this project, analyzes
            what has happend in the past, or what is happening in present, and
            understand it, allowing us to better understand future events.

            As we carried on with the course, and started understanding how
            to 'decode' and 'understand' nature, one question occurred.
            "Would I be able to 'decode the nature' of NYUAD?"

            With this, I started this project with the plan to get inputs
            of students' thoughts by displaying certain keywords
            and displaying what sutdents think. </h2>

          <h2>While the initial plan was to get inputs from the student body,
          due to time constrainsts, this part has not been implemented yet.

          In the future, the functionality of getting user inputs and displyaing
          them rather than personally set inputs will give a better view of
          what people might think regarding the keywords.

          If interested in the project, please keep an eye on how this project
          progresses. </h2>
